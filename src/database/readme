Huzaifa uploads a video
We get MD5 of the file
We store MD5 with filename, url and key from CDN.
Step 4: We get 'mediaId' from table.
We store on videos table or any other relevant table.

Anas uploads a video
We get MD5 of the file
We check whether MD5 exists in storage table.
If exists, re-use the same mediaId.
If not, insert and step 4 again.

Anas deletes the video
We check whether the mediaId is used more than once.
If so, skip deletion from CDN.
If not, delete the mediaId together with it's relational rows, and then delete file from CDN.
