        <p>
            If you want to learn Computer Science and you’re just starting out, you probably have a lot of questions. What programming languages should I learn? Is it enough to learn one or two programming languages to secure a good job at a big tech company? What other skills do I need, if any?

With so much information out there, aspiring software engineers can find it difficult to ferret out the valuable information from the rubbish.

I know how it is because I’ve been there too.

Needless to say, it took me a long time to find the answers that I needed.  But it doesn’t have to be like that for you.
